          Member Home is the first page USAA members see after logging in. It’s where members can access and organize their accounts and policies, initiate common actions, like transferring funds, and keep track of ongoing activity, like an insurance claim. It’s a complex space of intersecting systems and information.

                  This project started in response to years of negative member feedback on the previous private homepage. It had been 10 years since the page was touched and a redesign was long overdue. There were many problem areas to address including…

                  We started by developing an understanding of what the space needed to do, digging into member feedback and understanding stakeholder issues and goals. Initial research and analysis informed our foundational goals for the experience.

              How did these goals take form?

          <!-- <div class="projectpagebody__description"> -->
            
            <p>
              We can see our goals come to life through the structure, visual design, and offerings of the page. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The structure is composed of two high level sections, products (left column) and activity (right column). This simple division sets clear expectations for where to find information, drastically improving navigation. 
            </p>

            <p>
              The visual design takes a minimalist approach, bringing the most important data to the forefront and allowing members to focus on the task at hand without the distractions of irrelevant promotions and overbearing branding.
            </p>

            <p>
              Arguably the most important process, what the page offers was critically analyzed. Assessing and filtering which elements deserved to live on the page immediately created a simpler experience and establishing strict standards for future content add requests allows us to preserve simplicity and focus over time.

            <p>
              We arrived at a tab bar organization divided into three spaces of ‘Home’, ‘Search’, and ‘Chat’.

            </p>

            <p>
              Home, being our focus, contains a mix of cards that organize members’ products, provide entry points to common actions and new product acquisition, deliver personalized ads, and helpful content or reminders like upcoming bills and travel notices. 

            </p>
            
            <p>
              All of the content on Home is automatically prioritized based on the member’s activity and product relationship with USAA.

            <p>
              USAA members have a wide variety of relationships with the company and unique ways of organizing their stuff. Currently, members have anywhere between 0 and nearly 100 bank accounts, insurance policies, and aggregated investments. On top of this, members might hide accounts, create groups, or see asset and liability totals depending on their product mix.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              Our solution to accommodating any number of products was to offer an expanded card state, when needed. This way, if a member has 6 or more products in a card, they are able to see some of their stuff in the collapsed state and the rest in the expanded state.

            </p>

            <p>
              This allows members to access all their stuff from one page without detracting from the value USAA provides through activity cards or the business’ marketing needs. This model also allowed us to avoid confusing interactions when integrating our customization features.
