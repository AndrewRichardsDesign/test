                </h1>
    
                <p>
                  Besides minor updates, the app has not been redesigned since about 2007. It was not meeting member needs, yet its utilization was on the rise, quickly overtaking the website.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The app was slow in terms of navigation and performance. It didn’t allow members to view the information they needed most and navigation was confusing.

                <p>
                  My team and I drastically simplified the UX, making the app and website familiar experiences. We aligned the taxonomy, structure, and concepts across platforms, defined the app’s overall interaction model, then fleshed out two heavily trafficked parts of the app, the public and private homepage experiences.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Our efforts helped determine how USAA embraces platform conventions while digitally expressing its brand and influenced our new native design language system.

                <p>
                  This was also a challenge in communication and collaboration. I learned how to better navigate a space with multiple design teams involved, conflicting viewpoints from business and development, and overbearing executive direction.

              Years of data and member feedback brought to light many problems with the design.

              <li>

              </li>
  
              <li>
                Members struggled with basic navigation which increased volume to call centers, often an avoidable cost for the company. 
              </li>
              
              <li>
                Data and the company’s understanding of individual members was being severely underutilized, as product advertisements and advice were often irrelevant and thus, ignored.
              </li>
  
              <li>
                The basic structure of the app was not meeting the core need of quickly accessing accounts and policies. Members wanted to see everything they owned at the top level.
  
              <li>
                The rate of product acquisition in native was not keeping up with the shift to this platform.

              In an effort to drive alignment across platforms and simplify the UX, we incorporated concepts and structures that we had previously developed for the redesign of our website’s private homepage. We tackled challenges like how members...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              We arrived at a tab bar organization divided into three spaces of ‘Home’, ‘Search’, and ‘Chat’.

            </p>

            <p>
              Home, being our focus, contains a mix of cards that organize members’ products, provide entry points to common actions and new product acquisition, deliver personalized ads, and helpful content or reminders like upcoming bills and travel notices. 

            </p>
            
            <p>
              All of the content on Home is automatically prioritized based on the member’s activity and product relationship with USAA.

            <p>
              USAA members have a wide variety of relationships with the company and unique ways of organizing their stuff. Currently, members have anywhere between 0 and nearly 100 bank accounts, insurance policies, and aggregated investments. On top of this, members might hide accounts, create groups, or see asset and liability totals depending on their product mix.
            </p>
        
            <p>
              Our solution to accommodating any number of products was to offer an expanded card state, when needed. This way, if a member has 6 or more products in a card, they are able to see some of their stuff in the collapsed state and the rest in the expanded state.

            </p>

            <p>
              This allows members to access all their stuff from one page without detracting from the value USAA provides through activity cards or the business’ marketing needs. This model also allowed us to avoid confusing interactions when integrating our customization features.
