                <p>
                  This effort overhauled the design and performance of the iOS, Android,
                  and iPadOS apps. Starting from the groundwork we laid in the Member Home redesign for web, my team redesigned the IA and structure,
                  while helping to develop a new design language and balance platform conventions with brand presence.

                <p>
                  My team and I drastically simplified the user experience and aligned it to our website. To achieve this, we aligned the taxonomy, structure, and concepts across platforms, defined the app’s overall interaction model, then fleshed out two heavily trafficked parts of the app, the public and private homepage experiences.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the most critical steps and immense challenges was balancing native platform conventions with brand presence, as a new brand was being refined and adapted for digital spaces.
                </p>
                  
                <p>
                  This project challenged us at every turn, pushing back on ingrained business and development mindsets, advocating for best design practices in the midst of conflicting executive direction, and continuously syncing with a mix of other design teams converting their experiences to the new app.
                </p>

                <p>
                  These efforts laid much of the groundwork for both how USAA expresses its brand digitally and for our new native design language system. Below, I shared parts of the project that I personally worked on, either individually or collaboratively.

              Our project goals were clear as the needs of the space were deeply understood with years of data and member feedback. 
            </p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>
                The old app’s interface contained irrelevant content to members, distracting them from what they were there to do. 
              </li>
  
              <li>
                Members struggled with basic navigation which increased volume to call centers, often an avoidable cost for the company. 
              </li>
              
              <li>
                Data and the company’s understanding of individual members was being severely underutilized, as product advertisements and advice were often irrelevant and thus, ignored.
              </li>
  
              <li>
                The basic structure of the app was not meeting the core need of quickly accessing accounts and policies. Members wanted to see everything they owned at the top level.            </li>
  
              <li>
                The rate of product acquisition in native was not keeping up with the shift to this platform.

            <p>
              In an effort to drive alignment across platforms and simplify the UX, we incorporated many of the concepts and structures we developed in the redesign of our website’s private homepage. We asked ourselves how members...
            </p>
            

            
            <ul>
              <li>
                access their accounts and policies?
              </li>
  
              <li>
                engage with servicing actions like transferring funds?
              </li>
              
              <li>
                navigate to summary pages?
              </li>
  
              <li>
                acquire new products?
  
              <li>
                consume marketing?
              </li>

              <li>
                engage with automatically prioritized content from USAA?
              </li>

              <li>
                consume access features like search and chat?
              </li>



            </ul>


            <p>
              To meet these needs, we explored many concepts and arrived at a tab bar organization divided by ‘Home’, ‘Search’, and ‘Chat’, creating three distinct spaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              Home, being our focus, contains individual cards for each product category: Banking, Insurance, Investing, and Advice & Services. Each one of these cards contains related actions, like transferring funds or depositing money. This is also where members can access their accounts, policies, and personalized product suggestions...yes, marketing had to be included to keep the business going! We made sure it was done tastefully.
            </p>

            <p>
              The ‘Home’ page also contains ‘activity cards’, which is personalized content generated by USAA based on a member’s relationship with the company or their actions. A couple examples include upcoming bills or a travel notice. 
            </p>

            <p>
              All of the content on Home is automatically prioritized based on business logic, the needs of the member, and the member’s product relationship with USAA.
            </p>
